# NLP-Grammar-Writing
Second Assignment in 'NLP - Natural Languages Processing' course by Prof. Yoav Goldberg, Prof. Ido Dagan and Prof. Reut Tsarfaty at Bar-Ilan University.

**<ins>Goal:</ins>**
This assignment is meant to help us understand how Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) work, and how they can be used - sometimes comfortably, sometimes not so much - to describe natural language. It also made me think about some linguistic phenomena that are interesting in their own right.

**<ins>The assignment consists of the following parts:</ins>**
* <ins>Part 0</ins> - Generating Sentences from a CFG
* <ins>Part 1</ins> - Weights
* <ins>Part 2</ins> - Extending the Grammar
* <ins>Part 3</ins> - Tree Structures
* <ins>Part 4</ins> - Additional Linguistic Structures
* <ins>Part 5</ins> - Extra

**<ins>Score:</ins>** 100
